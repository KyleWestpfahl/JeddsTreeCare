<h2>John Smith</h2>
<p>Jedds Tree Care was effcient, reliable, and extremly professional when handling my tree care needs</p>
<h2>Will Sutton</h2>
<p>When this job first was started, I would have given about 2 stars. Now that the whole job is completely finished I will go with 5. Throughout this it seemed like communication was very bad between the scheduler and the work  crew and after a follow-up visit to do a few things at this point I'm completely happy with the work that was done.</p>
<h2>Mark Johnson</h2>
<p>Reasonable prices. Very impressed with the work and cleanup was perfect. I highly recommend this company. We have had other companies do tree work and the way they left the yard was terrible. They came in and got the trees down and cleaned up in no time. Very happy with the results.</p>
<h2>Dale Little</h2>
<p>I couldn't recommend this company more. Frank was prompt, polite, and most importantly he gave me a great deal on removing a giant Silver Maple from my front yard. His quote was substantially less than other companies, and the work they did was top notch. 100% will recommend Frank's Tree Service to anyone looking for tree removal!</p>
